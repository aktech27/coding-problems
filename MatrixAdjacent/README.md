# Sum of adjacent elements

Write a program to find two adjacent numbers from a given matrix that when added gives the desired output. The numbers can be adjacent either horizantally, vertically or diagnally.

## Example 1

```
1  3  4  6  2


3  5  8  9  0


1  7  3  2  4


2  3  1  4  2


6  4  3  2  1

If the sum of the numbers is specified as 10, then the output should be
4 + 6 : 10
7 + 3 : 10
7 + 3 : 10
6 + 4 : 10
3 + 7 : 10
8 + 2 : 10

```
